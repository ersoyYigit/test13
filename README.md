## Welcome Airport Servives app

- This application is created with [Remix](https://remix.run/docs)

### Development
Reqirements: 
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  ```sh
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

Install all dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```
Start the Remix development asset server and the Express server by running:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when Remix rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server.
